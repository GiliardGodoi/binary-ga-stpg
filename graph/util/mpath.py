    Return: <vertice - distance from source> - distance dictionary from the source to vertice
            < vertice - previou > - a dictionary representing a previous node

    An early implementation has O(n^2) complexity. 
    Many improvements have been proposed across the years. 
    They are more complicated, though.

    Based in Chirantan Sharma's code

    Its use an other Priority Queue implemantation which it is not used by Sharma.
